# Google Book Search
This full-stack web app is a simple CRUD app that allows the user to search the google books api and then save results to a database for future browsing.

The app uses a React front end that interacts with a Node.js backend. The Node.js backend is using the Express server library and connected to a MongoDB database using the Mongoose library.

The app is deployed to Heroku for demo purposes.
